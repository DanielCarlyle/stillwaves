         <p>StillWaves formed from a mutual love and admiration of post-punk legends like Killing Joke, The Sound and
            The Chameleons. Daniel Carlyle and Eric Pentz had met, formerly, various hazy nights in Toronto, and
            eventually assembled to begin crafting their sound and their goals.</p>
         <p>After several fun and arduous months of writing and rehearsing, they took a chance, sending some poorly recorded, lo-fi
            phone demos to local producer/musician/recording wizard Josh Korody, and he liked it enough to record their
            first album. Recorded and produced by Korody(Beliefs/Breeze/Wish) and mastered by Jesse Keeler (Death from
            Above/Mstrkrft), The self-titled album also features drums by Mike Wallace, of Canadian post-punk
            heavyweights Preoccupations.</p>
         <p>Carlyle's vocals and the themes of the songs focus on topics like the (often) sombre state of the world,
            modern addiction to technology, social media vanity, imbued with the inherent inequalities of the world.
            Dark music, for dark times indeed. Restless souls generate restless music.</p>
