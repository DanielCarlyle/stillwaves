70% of today’s WordPress installations are vulnerable to known exploits (and WordPress powers more than 25% of the web). WordPress is used by 58.8% of all the websites whose content management system we know. This is [25.4% of all websites](http://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cm-wordpress/all/all) 

We pay a huge price for the underlying complexity of dynamic code running on a server for every request — a price we could avoid paying entirely when this kind of complexity is not needed.

Avoid common WP problems like: 

- My blog loading slowly.
- My blog crashing during peak periods.
- My blog becoming infected with malware.
