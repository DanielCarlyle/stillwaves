                        <strong>BIO:</strong><br><br>
                        StillWaves formed from a mutual love and admiration of post-punk heavyweights like Killing Joke,
                        The
                        Sound and The Chameleons. Daniel Carlyle and Eric Pentz had met various hazy nights in Toronto,
                        and
                        eventually came together and began writing and crafting their sound.

                        After several months of writing and rehearsing, they took a chance, sending some poorly recorded
                        demos
                        to local producer/musician and recording guru Josh Korody, and he liked it enough to record
                        their
                        first
                        album. Recorded and Produced by Korody and mastered by Jesse Keeler (Death from Above/Mstrkrft),
                        The
                        album tentatively titled, 'Regressing Times,' also features drums by Mike Wallace
                        (Preoccupations).

                        Carlyle's vocals and the themes of the songs focus on topics like the (often) sombre state of
                        the
                        world,
                        past scorned love, and the inherent inequalities of the world. Dark music, for dark times
                        indeed.
                        Restless souls make restless music.

                        <strong>Information about the release:</strong><br><br>
                        'Regressing Times' addresses the destructive inherent ego and vanity humans possess, and how our
                        actions
                        often seem to regress, despite existing in a time of exceptional technological and social
                        advances.

                        In the video, scientists create beams to the moon, one more example of our curiosity, but also
                        our
                        capitalist drive and sense of entitlement. Something comes back down the surge, something you
                        can't
                        put
                        back.

                        Meanwhile, people dance the night away, blissfully unaware of what heads their way. The sole
                        person
                        at
                        the dance sitting down, arms crossed, represents the small minority that knows there are some
                        things
                        we
                        should leave alone.
