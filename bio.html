            <p>I am a professional film and television editor based in Toronto, Canada. My background is in the fine arts: drawing and painting. I explored my passion for filmmaking while attending art school and discovered my favorite role was editing. </p>

            <p>As a resident editor at the Canadian Film Centre, I had the opportunity to further develop my storytelling skills and concentrate on scripted narrative filmmaking. I collaborated with talented directors from across Canada making high caliber films, representing diverse experiences and voices.</p>
                
            <p>As a freelance editor I work in several genres, including documentaries, short films, comedy, scripted narrative television and factual television. I gained important edit room experience working on premium projects, including Big Little Lies (Season 2), The Art of More, Pillars of the Earth and The Weekend Sailor.</p>
                
            <p>My editing work has been screened at numerous film festivals internationally such as TIFF, FIFA Montreal, DOC LA and Madrid International Film Festival and is broadcast on the Discovery Channel, Cooking Channel, History Channel, Netflix, SyFy, CBC, Vice and Sony Entertainment. </p>
